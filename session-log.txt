USER: ok, so, we're trying to use the media-stack jellyfin right now, on this live production server where this cutrsor instance is operating. As we're watching the movie "IF", the movie keeps "freezing" for a few seconds, then playback continues. This is on a macbook on safari. I am looking at the grafana dashboards we set up looking for some indication of what the bottleneck or issue might be, but I can't see anything to explain what could be causing the freezes. There's one happening at this very second. Can you look and see what's going on?

ASSISTANT: Absolutely, let's troubleshoot the Jellyfin streaming freezes. Here's a systematic approach: [...summary of approach...]

USER: start by checking current system resource usage

COMMAND: top -b -n 1 | head -20
